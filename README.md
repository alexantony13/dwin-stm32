# DWIN UART Display Interface Library for STM32

This repository provides a C library and accompanying resources to facilitate communication between STM32 microcontrollers and DWIN DGUS-II UART displays.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Modular Design**: Easy integration into existing STM32 projects.
- **Advanced STM32 UART**: Uses DMA transfer and Idle Line Detection of STM32 uart peripheral.
- **Example Project**: Ready-to-use STM32CubeIDE project to kickstart development.
- **UI Tools**: DGUS and GIMP project files for customizing display interfaces.

## üõ† Requirements

- **Hardware**:
  - STM32 microcontroller development board.
  - DWIN DGUS-II UART display.
  - ST-Link Programmer for flashing the microcontroller.
  - USB-to-UART TTL converter or SD card for updating the display.

- **Software**:
  - [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)
  - [DWIN DGUS Tool](https://www.dwin-global.com/product/DGUS_V7.6/) 
  - [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) or suitable image editor.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alexantony13/dwin-stm32.git
   ```

2. **Open Example Project**:
   - Open STM32CubeIDE.
   - The exapmle project is located at `exapmles/STM32CubeIDE/dwin-stm32-testing`.
   - Open the example project using `File > Open Projects from File System...` menu option.
     - Note: The library is added as a linked source folder.
   - Open `dwin-stm32-testing.ioc` file and review the UART, Clock and GPIO settings.

3. **Build and Flash**:
   - Compile and flash the firmware to your STM32 board.

4. **Load DGUS Project**:
   - Open `DWIN DGUS Tool`.
   - Open the example project: `examples\DGUS\dwin-stm32-test`.
   - Upload to the display

5. **Connect display and STM32 uart pins**:
   - Connect STM32 UART Tx to Display Rx
   - Connect STM32 UART Rx to Display Tx
   - Connect STM32 GND to display GND
   - Use level shifters if needed. (If stm32 uart pins are not 5v tolerant.)
